// this is what you would do if you were one to do things the easy way:
// var parseJSON = JSON.parse;

// but you're not, so you'll write it from scratch:
var parseJSON = function(json) {
  // your code goes here
  //input: json obj
  //output: destringified version of json obj which may be various types such as arr, obj, num, str, bool, null, 
  //constraints: must have matching braces in case of obj and matching bracket in case of arr
  //edge cases: none

//pseudo

//make helper func to check next character to keep track of where you are in json str
  //currentcharind = currentcharindex++ 
  //next char = json[currentCharInd];
  

//create current char var to maintain where we are
  //set current char to json[1]
//create var index to keep track of current char index

//function parse num '9', 'false', 'str', 'null'

//function parse bool

//function parse str

//function parse null

//function parse obj

//function parse arr

//if num
//if bool
//if str
//if null


};
